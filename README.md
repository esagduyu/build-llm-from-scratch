This is my version of the code from the book ["Build an LLM from Scratch" by Sebastian Raschka](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Large-Language-Model-Scratch/dp/1633437167). The original source for the code can be found in his repo [here](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main).

To learn better, I am trying to actually do all of this by hand so it should be all coded from scratch by me.

For environment setup, I am using uv as suggested in [his setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcWnfsZhzo)
